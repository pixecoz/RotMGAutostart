3. Open console. (Win+R, then cmd)
4. Move to the folder with downloaded files and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` command.
5. Run `.pyw` file and have fun!

If steam force you to choose an account, you can try disable following setting:

`Steam > Settings > Interface > Ask which account to use each time Steam starts`
