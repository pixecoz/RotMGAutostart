# RotMGAutostart
Launches Realm of the Mad God (Steam version) via Python script. After successful launch kills Steam and launcher processes.

Little instruction:
1. Download files `update.png` & `play.png` & `RotMGAutostart.pyw` & `requirements.txt`, then put them in _one_ folder.
2. Make sure Python and pip installed on your machine.
3. Open console. (Win+R, then cmd)
4. Move to the folder with downloaded files and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` command.
5. Run `.pyw` file and have fun!

Works fine on Windows 11 with python 3.12.
